# PasswordGenerator
This team project involves: html, css, and javascript. **I worked on the JavaScript code, and a little bit of html and css.**
We were provided with a scenario to provide a client with the ability to obtain a strong password.

**User Story**
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

**Acceptance Criteria**
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
I am presented with a series of inputs for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all criteria are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is written to the page
